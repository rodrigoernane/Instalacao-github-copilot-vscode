# Roulette Game

Welcome to the Roulette Game project! This project is a simple implementation of a roulette game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game incorporates physics laws for the ball's movement and utilizes the HTML canvas for rendering shapes and animations.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Roulette Game, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd roulette-game
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Open the game**:
   Open `src/index.html` in your web browser to start playing the game.

## How to Play

- Spin the roulette wheel and watch the ball bounce around before it lands on a number.
- The game simulates realistic physics for the ball's movement, making it an engaging experience.
